A simple script that will automate mouse and keyboard movements.

If you need to keep your computer awake for awhile and you don't feel like changing your system settings this is for you.

If you have a boring job and want to trick microsoft Teams or your boss that you are active this is also for you.

## About
This app leverages the pyautogui api and all of its dependencies. It is minimal code and I aim to make it user friendly.

<ins>Why not write it in c/c++ and make an exe?</ins><br>
Not everyone will have c/c++ on their system and python is by far the easiest to install and run. Maybe I will re-make this in c/c++. For now a python version is dead easy to use without having to download a bunch of shit.

### Versions
- Linux - In Development
- Windows - In Development

They should work the same, but I have noticed that pyautogui doesn't play as nice in debian. Works fine in Windows.

<ins>Why is there not a MAC version.?</ins><br>
I don't have a MAC laying around to test with. According to the API author it should work fine with MAC OS.
